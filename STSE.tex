\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	Video inpainting targets to fill the missing regions in videos, which requires high spatio-temporal consistency.
	However, recent deep-learning based methods focus on temporally smoothening inpainted frames via motion information, but the detailed structure clues are much less explored.
	In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal Structure Enhancement Network (SSENet) for structure-preserved video inpainting. 
	Specifically, SSENet first synthesizes the edge information across frames, based on an encoder-decoder with heterogeneous receptive field. Then, a coarse-to-fine adversarial model is designed for frame inpainting.
	Explicitly, a structure attention module is developed to extract the spatial correlation between video contents and completed edge. This can facilitate the structure-enhanced video inpainting.  
	Meanwhile, the missing flow is also predicted to ensure the temporal consistency of both edge and video frames, via flow-guided warping and temporal ensemble.  
	Consequently, the inpainted frames by SSENet are visually pleasing in detailed structures and temporally stabilized, with low time cost. 
	Experiments on YouTubeVOS and DAVIS show that SSENet obtains state-of-the-art performance and few artifacts, which demonstrate the significance of structure enhancement in video inpainting.
